## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
1) Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
- Vehicle Length and Ground Clearance
2) Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
- The slope of linear model is not zero because there are variables correlating with mpg. 
3) Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
- The R-squared value predicted the MechaCar prototypes mpg values 71.49% of the time, which is reasonably high enough to say yes it does predict mpg. Many factors could increase the effectiveness of this model.
